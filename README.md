An interactive retelling of [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com) [Portal History](https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history/flash-portal-history?path=/wiki/about-newgrounds/history/flash-portal-history) and the [Clock Crew](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockcrew) from the perspective of [Strawberry Clock](https://strawberryclock.newgrounds.com/).

### About

Clock Crew Crock (AKA CCC) was made for [Clock Day 2021](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2021)  
(a celebration that occurs every August 15th - there's a whole [history](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockcrewhistory)).

Strictly speaking, CCC is a clicker/incremental game, but it plays more like an interactive story (that is mostly apocryphal and entirely satirical!).

Since I don't really like incremental games that are either endless or take a long time to finish (eg: longer than a week), this game is short and sweet. (Like a strawberry!)
You can beat it in under 5 minutes.
