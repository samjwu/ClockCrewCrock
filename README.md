# Clock Crew Crock

> *Try saying THAT 10 times really fast*

An interactive retelling of [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com) [Portal History](https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history/flash-portal-history?path=/wiki/about-newgrounds/history/flash-portal-history) and the [Clock Crew](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockcrew) from the perspective of [Strawberry Clock](https://strawberryclock.newgrounds.com/).

### About

Clock Crew Crock (AKA CCC) was made for [Clock Day 2021](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2021)  
(a celebration that occurs every August 15th - there's a whole [history](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockcrewhistory)).

Strictly speaking, CCC is a clicker/incremental game, but it plays more like an interactive story (that is mostly apocryphal and entirely satirical!).

Since I don't really like incremental games that are either endless or take a long time to finish (eg: longer than a week), this game is short and sweet (like a strawberry!).  
You can beat it in under 5 minutes.

### <s>Excuses</s> Reasons for making this game

If you're wondering about why the quality is so low, that's intentional.  
Yep.  
Definitely not due to a lack of effort on my part.  

It's certainly better than [B](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/28240)  
For those who don't know, B is a flash "animation" that is just the capital letter "B" on a white background. For 23 seconds. Where nothing else happens.  
I have no idea why this piece of trash -uhh I mean piece de resistance- is celebrated despite being absolute garbage -ahh I mean an absolute masterpiece-, but it is.

Since the original idea of Clock Day was to submit something that appears poorly made yet is humorous and satirical (I think), perhaps this is a suitable submission maybe?

I like to think this is an example of the latter.
